Examples
--------

You can build the examples provided here by running gcmc on the sources and
generate either G-code, SVG or DXF output.

The examples include a special marker if they require additional command-line
options. The following script can create all formats from the examples. Save
the script as buildexamples.sh, set mode with "chmod +x buildexamples.sh" and
run it with:
  $ ./buildexamples.sh *.gcmc

--- cut-here ---
#!/bin/bash
for i in $@
do
	opts=$(grep @@@ "$i" | sed -e's,.*@@@\(.*\)@@@.*,\1,')
	base=$(basename "$i" .gcmc)
	echo "Building example ${i}..."
	gcmc --gcode $opts -o "${base}.ngc" "$i"
	gcmc --svg   $opts -o "${base}.svg" "$i"
	gcmc --dxf   $opts -o "${base}.dxf" "$i"
done
--- cut-here ---


Windows users without a bash shell and appropriate utilities can compile the
examples on a standard command-line and may recover any added gcmc options for
the examples from the example's source file (the part enclosed in @@@).
