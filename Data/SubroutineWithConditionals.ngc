#100 = 5

(examples of logical operations)
(result is 1 if condition is true)
(result is 0 if condition is false)

#101 = [#100 >  5]
#102 = [#100 >= 5]
#103 = [#100 <  5]
#104 = [#100 <= 5]
#105 = [#100 =  5]
#106 = [#100 <> 5]

(subroutine call can be looped a number of times)
(the L or Q word may be used to specify the count)
(if neither L or Q is specified a count of 1 is used)
(if the count is 0 the subroutine will not be called at all)

M98 P1 L3  (example using L to specify the loop count)
M98 P1 Q3  (example using Q to specify the loop count)

M98 P1 L#100  (example using a variable loop count)

M98 P1 L[5 > 4]  (example using a conditional as a loop count)
