    <p>Rapid move to a point. (Not necessarily in a straight line!)</p>
    <p>G0 (G zero) tells the machine to move as quickly as possible to a given point (absolute or relative, depending on the setting of G90 or 91). This command is <strong>modal</strong>, so any coordinates that follow will be rapid as well (until a Group 01 code is called).&nbsp; As with all G codes, it specifies only the destination point.&nbsp; HINT: It is usually a good idea to pull the Z up to a safe distance before executing a G0, since the path is not a straight line.&nbsp; Also, never rapid to or from a position too close to the workpiece.&nbsp; Leave some room for lead-ins and lead-outs.&nbsp; Be aware of the decimal point!</p>
    <p>
        Takes the arguments (X, Y, Z, A, B).<br>
        Each of these is optional, A and B are for rotary axes.&nbsp; Notice there is no argument for feed rate, it is the machine max.

    <h2>Example:</h2>
    <p>Assume the machine is currently at X0.0 Y0.0 and G90 is enabled. for the following code:</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">G0 X3.0 Y1.0 ;</p>
    <p>The toolpath will look like this:</p>
    <p><a href="G00.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2816" title="G00" src="G00.png" alt="" width="600" height="231"></a></p>
    <p>Don’t make the mistake of thinking the path looks like the one shown below in red! This is a crash waiting to happen.</p>
    <p><a href="Not-G00.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2817" title="Not G00" src="Not-G00.png" alt="" width="600" height="227"></a></p>
    <p>The above example assumes milling, for turning, the only difference is the interpretation of the coordinate system.</p>
