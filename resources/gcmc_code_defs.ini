//The endpoint vector and each vector in vectorlist points may consist of up to nine coordinates and are interpreted for axis XYZABCUVW respectively. Coordinates for axes XYZ and UVW are interpreted with distance units and axes ABC are interpreted with angular units. The absolute position before the movement is returne
goto=vector goto(vector:endpoint ); Rapid move (G0) to position endpoint
move=vector move (vector:endpoint [,scalar:rate])| Feed move (G1) to position endpoint, or all position in vectorlist points.| The endpoint/points position is an absolute position for move()| and a relative position for move_r()
